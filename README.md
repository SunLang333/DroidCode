# DroidCode: Advanced Android WebView Application

DroidCode is an innovative Android project that demonstrates modern app development techniques by integrating a customized local web server with an embedded WebView. This project leverages advanced technologies and frameworks to deliver a seamless and powerful experience.

## Key Features

- **Local Web Server with NanoHTTPD:**  
  Implements a lightweight, yet robust local web server that serves assets directly from the Android assets folder. This elegant solution enables efficient handling of static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files.

- **Seamless WebView Integration:**  
  Combines the power of Android's WebView with a local back-end server to provide a smooth user experience while accessing dynamic web content. The app loads the forefront web interface (powered by VS Code Web at [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev)) with minimal overhead.

- **Advanced File Handling:**  
  Features a comprehensive file chooser dialog using `WebChromeClient`, enabling users to interact with file uploads directly within the WebView. Integrated support for file downloads via Android's `DownloadManager` ensures a polished user experience, with attention to file access security and performance.

- **Modern Android Development Practices:**  
  Developed using Kotlin and Java, the project adheres to clean architecture and best practices. It demonstrates proficiency in Android Studio, Gradle configurations, and dynamic resource management, highlighting the depth of technical skills.

- **Responsive & Secure:**  
  Supports secure data handling with cleartext traffic permissions managed in the manifest. The design ensures compatibility across various Android devices, emphasizing performance alongside robust security measures.

## Technical Highlights

- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
  Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, Gradle

- **User Experience Enhancements:**  
  Custom implementations for file uploads and downloads create an engaging and interactive application, enabling users to seamlessly navigate and interact with web content from within the native Android environment.

DroidCode stands as a testament to advanced Android development, showcasing a blend of native and web technologies that pushes the boundaries of mobile app innovation. Its integration of a local server with a feature-rich WebView not only provides a proof-of-concept but also paves the way for more complex hybrid applications.
